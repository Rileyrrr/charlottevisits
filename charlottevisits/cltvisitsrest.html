<h2>Best Restauraunts in Charlotte, North Carolina </h2>
<p class="projectleft">We all love going to eat somewhere that has good food, good service, and good customer hospitality. So here is an awesome list I have compiled of 
the best restaurants in Charlotte.</p>
<h2>#1 Luce </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/luce.jpg" alt="broken"> </figure>
<p class="projtext">When you think of a high-end Italian restaurant perfect for a date for 2 that not only has great food but above the line hospitality this restaurant comes to mind. 
with a beautiful inside decor this place ranks as one of the best Italian spots in Charlotte. The price to eat at this place is about mid to high end with a plate starting around $25. 
</p>
<br/>
	<br/>
<h2>#2 Mimosa Grill</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/mimosa.jpg" alt="broken"> </figure>
<p class="projtext">The best part about Mimosa is the fact that each time you go the menu changes depending on the chef. The owners of the Harpers restaurants also own this high-end restaurant in the downtown area of Charlotte.
 Being around since 1995 this restaurant offers people something different with their global cuisines, that have a unique southern twist. During the Covid-19 pandemic, this place has been offering a variety of fried chicken if you order through them with Doordash only. 
 It's kind of secret but most people just don't know about it.
</p>
<br/>
	<br/>
<h2>#3 Cow Fish </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/cowfish.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext">Cowfish is a well-known Sushi restaurant located at South Park Mall. But this place doesn't serve the type of sushi that you are probably familiar with. This restaurant throws there own unique twist in by creating a new type of sushi called "burgushi." 
This place is a burger and sushi bar so literally, you could find almost anything you want to eat at this place and they will probably have it. With good appetizers and great sushi rolls and burgers, this place is always a top contender to be one of the best in Charlotte.</p>
<br/>
	<br/>

<h2>#4 Amélie's French Bakery and Café</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/amelies.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext">So far this list has been showing you high-end restaurants and maybe that's not quite what you are looking for as you might just want a quick bite to eat at a better price but still want the quality of authentic good food. Meet Amelies, a French 
bakery, and cafe that prides itself on serving the best authentic-French inspired pastries, soups, and savories. If you are looking for a French food option this would be a good choice for you.
</p>

<br/>
	<br/>
<h2>#5 Mellow Mushroom </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/mellow.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext">Now Mellow Mushroom is nothing new but every Mellow Mushroom has a cool and unique atmosphere to it. There are 2 different locations in the Charlotte location one of them is downtown and one is in South Charlotte. 
They serve pizza and great appetizers. They have really good homemade pretzels on top of how great their pizza already is so you really can't go wrong with the price or the quality food.
</p>
<br/>
	<br/>
<h2>#6 Hello, Sailor</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/hellosailor.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext"> What makes this place so unique and on almost every top 10 list of best restaurants in Charlotte is not only that they have good food but the location that this place sits at. Right on Lake Norman, you can find this place with an awesome lakeside view and dock. 
This place is awesome for the person wanting to eat some southern seafood while getting a great view of the lake.
</p>

<br/>
	<br/>

<h2>#7 Roosters Wood Fired Kitchen </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/roosters.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext">Roosters Wood Fired Kitchen offers something different by using only locally grown food sources.  They have connections with local farmers that produce products just for them such as sourcing little gem lettuces for their salad. 
Roosters is a food and wine bar featuring a menu of Spanish, French, and Italian dishes all prepared on a wood-fired grill.
</p>


<br/>
	<br/>

<h2>#8 Midnight diner </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/midnight.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext"> Midnight Diner is a classic American diner great for grabbing a quick bite to eat at an affordable price. The food is superb either for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack this place fills all of those brackets. 
Did I also mention that it's very affordable? plate, or why not try both at the same time. The atmosphere of the place is very unique and like nothing else in Charlotte. This place is great for dates and late nights with friends.
</p>

<h2>#9 Dresslers </h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/dresslers.jpg" alt="broken"></figure>
<p class="projtext">Dressler's is a family-run restaurant that now has multiple locations. It s a higher-end place with slightly lower prices than most of the other high-end restaurants in Charlotte, and they serve amazing food and provide you with great service. 
The philosophy of this place is to treat every person that walks through the door as a family and that has helped this place succeed. With a relaxed atmosphere and the uniqueness of the menu, there will be something that both of you like.

this place has left a lot of customers very satisfied with the food and the service. with over 1000 5 star reviews on Yelp, I think a lot of people would agree with me on the quality of the food and the service that they provide for you. </p>
