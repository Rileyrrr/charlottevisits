<p class="projtext">Lazy 5 Ranch is a unique experience that is hard to find anywhere else. Either you can take a ride on a carriage or if you want to take the risk you can drive your car through this ranch located in Mooresville about 30 minutes away from the downtown area. 
You can feed live animals whether it's a zebra, buffalo, or even an ostrich. As you guide yourself through the trail of unique live animals that you get to feed they provide some food for you too. The best part is they let you go through the trail as many times as you want. So go wild and be an animal!!!

They also have zip lines, mountain biking trails with bike rentals, and even rock climbing walls. A lot of people come and visit the White Water Center without even stepping foot in a raft because of all the other things they have to do there.
