<h2>About Page</h2>
<p class="projtext"> Hi I am Riley, the creator of the website. The purpose I set out when creating this website was to give people a place to come if they were ever interested in exploring the city of Charlotte. This was just a fun idea I had to learn the ropes of 
CSS and HTML and how to put it all together into a not only functioning but useful website. </p>
<h2>Who am I? </h2>
<p class="projtext">My name is Riley Rossello I am a 20 year-old web student going for a web technology degree at Central Piedmont Community College. I live in the city of Charlotte currently but was born right outside of Detroit, Michigan. I have grown up mostly in the city here and plan
on living here for a while. Web designing has always sparked my intrest and learning it has been a lot of fun for me. </p>
<h2>What can you expect from this website? </h2>
<p class="projtext">You can expect to see a variety of restaurants and things to do that are all located within the Charlotte area. If you are from Charlotte you might learn something new and intriguing that was right under your nose and if you are from
out of town you could expect to see some pretty cool things you may have never even heard of before coming here. I hope you enjoy what I have put together and possibly put it too future use. </p>
